Summary: Moving from India to New York was a big change for me. Joe’s Pizza was a catalyst in building my affection for the city. Living right next to 13th Street, Joe’s got me through my years at college. It’s a place I visit because it perfectly encapsulates the feeling of moving to New York for the first time. The crowd is always so diverse, and the store is packed with customers even though it’s about as big as a bodega. The store is nothing fancy but that doesn’t stop celebrities such as Robert De Niro from being regular customers. It operates as a simple store, with a fixed variety of pizza. It always tastes just as good, and makes you feel the way you felt having it for the first time.
